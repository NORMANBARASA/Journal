# INTRODUCTION
Motorcycle injuries constitute a major but neglected emerging public health problem in
developing countries and are a common cause of road traffic injuries. This study was carried out
to determine factors associated with road traffic accidents involving motorcyclists in Mwea town,
Kirinyaga County.
# METHODOLOGY
A cross sectional descriptive study design was used. The instrument of data collection was
a semi-structured interviewer administered questionnaire. Data was analyzed using SPSS version
20. A total of 180 commercial motorcyclists participated.
A total of 68 (38%) had been involved in road traffic accidents in the past one year at
the time of the survey. Forty-seven (69.1%) of them had accidents once. Among those who were
involved in accidents in the last one year, 18 (26.5%) attributed the occurrence of accident to poor
visibility of the road, 16 (23.5%) to over speeding, 9 (13.2%) to careless motorists, and 6 (8.8%) to
potholes.
# CONCLUSION
The extend of accidents was higher among those who drink alcohol, 34 (69.4%), than
among those who donâ€™t, 34(26.0%) (P= 0.00). Majority of the accidents, 43 (63.2%) occurred as
a result of rolling after losing control. Excessive speed and alcohol use were identified as major
factors. Lack of helmet use among those involved in accidents was 41.2% which should be of
concern to the authority to ensure that proper education and awareness is disseminated
