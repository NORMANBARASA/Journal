# INTRODUCTION
Lack of HIV treatment and loss of follow up measures is associated with high mortality
among persons living with HIV (PLHIV) in sub-Saharan Africa. Especially in resource-limited
populations. Respondents diagnosed with HIV through a home-based testing and counseling
program in an informal settlement in Kenya, were referred to health facilities of their choice for
antiretroviral therapy (ART). This qualitative study explored the community’s experiences and
perceptions on factors associated with ART uptake and retention.
# METHODOLOGY
Using convenient purposive sampling, we recruited 46 adults (21 women and 25 men)
among them HIV infected and non-infected residents of the Kibera informal settlement in Nairobi,
Kenya. Using a standardized discussion guide, six focus group discussions of 6-9 individuals
were conducted. Discussions were recorded verbatim and complimented by tape recording to
ensure accuracy. Transcription was done and coding done using a Priori codes. Thematic content
analysis was done using Atlas 3.0. Availability of many health facilities offering HIV services in Kibera informal settlement
facilitated access to and uptake of ART. Respondents preparation procedures that prevented
same-day ART enrolment were often perceived as denial of treatment.
“They talk too much of treatment and when you go you are turned away” Said one
respondent. Reported perceived poor staff attitude, Rudeness, Judgmental behaviours and
Delays, were often perceived as lack of respect for Participants were reported to hinder retention
in ART services.
“He will look at your physical appearance, put your card aside and ask his colleague
whether tea is ready” Participants disliked adherence counseling with written commitments after
missed appointments and often felt that these measures too reflected lack of respect by health
care providers. They wanted to cancel treatment because they said we had to commit ourselves by
signing....”
# CONCLUSION
Individuals diagnosed with HIV generally accessed HIV treatment facilities following
referral after HBTC. Participants perceived some standard treatment procedures. Reckoning
Staff behavior and Communication as barriers hindering retention on ART. Supportive
interpersonal relationship strategies between Respondents, providers and innovative patient-
centered treatment plans and adherence counseling models should be adopted in treatment
programs. This will promote uptake and retention of ART in communities.
