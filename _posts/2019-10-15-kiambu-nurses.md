# BACKGROUND
Despite adoption of quality improvement initiatives in Kenyan Health facilities, quality
gains are not yet optimal in both public and private sector. The private sector, which includes
mission hospitals, face myriad of challenges ranging from perception of poor regulation to
unqualified staff and gaps in quality of care.
PURPOSE
To assess nurses’ perception on healthcare services' quality in mission hospitals in Kenya.
# METHOD
A descriptive cross-sectional study using quantitative and qualitative methods of data
collection. Simple random sampling was used to select 188 nurses for administration of self-
administered questionnaire. A total of 20 in-depth interviews and 4 focus group discussions were
conducted. Descriptive statistics and linear regression analysis were used to analyze quantitative
data using SPSS v20. Qualitative data was analyzed thematically using Nvivo v11.
# RESULTS
Overall nurses' perception of quality of services was 3.62. The perceived quality of
services processes was 3.5187. Length of patient-provider interaction (β=0.225, t=4.761, p=0.001),
teamwork (β=0.170, t=3.550, p=0.001), upholding patients’ rights (β=0.178, t=3.773, p=0.001),
capacity to conduct quality assessment (β =0.125, t=2.510, 0.013) and availability of effective
quality improvement teams (β=0.550, t=12.556, p=0.001).
# CONCLUSION
Nurses' perceived quality of services to be fair with a substantial room for improvement.
To achieve a competitive edge, it is imperative for the hospital's management to engage visionary
and quality conscious leaders, capable of identifying quality gaps and implementing improvement
initiatives. The initiatives should focus on institutionalizing team-based quality audits, developing
a quality patient-focused culture in service delivery.
